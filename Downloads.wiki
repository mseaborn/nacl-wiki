Native Client is a research technology,
and *we do not consider it secure*.
We encourage you to experiment with the technology,
but do so at your own risk.
Please [Uninstall uninstall the plug-in] when you're not using it for development or testing.
Whenever you reinstall the plug-in,
be sure to use the latest version.
