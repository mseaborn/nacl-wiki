#summary How to build standalone NaCl using Gyp

== Introduction ==
The `.gyp` files in the NaCl source tree serve two purposes:  they are used to build NaCl as part of Chromium (see ChromiumIntegration), and they can also be used to build NaCl standalone, as an alternative to the Scons build scripts.

== Standalone Linux Gyp build ==
In the top-level (`trunk/src`) directory:
 * `./native_client/build/gyp_nacl native_client/build/all.gyp -f make`
 * `make -j4`

== Standalone Windows Gyp build ==
In the top-level (`trunk/src`) directory:
 * If necessary:  run `vcvarsall.bat` from the Visual Studio/VC directory.
 * `set GYP_MSVS_VERSION=2008`
 * `gclient runhooks`
 * `devenv native_client\build\all.sln /build Debug`
It also works from the `native_client` directory:
 * `devenv build\all.sln /build Debug`
