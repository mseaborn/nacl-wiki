#summary Establishing a sandbox within Native Client's sandbox

= Guest code in Native Client =

== Introduction ==
Web apps may wish to run _guest code_ under Native Client -- that is, code which runs with less authority than the web app itself.  The guest code is less trusted than the main web app.

For example, guest code might not be allowed to use the cookies for the web app's origin.  Guest code might have limited access to the DOM.

== Requirements ==
 * No sources of ambient authority
    * In NaCl, this means there should be no system calls that provide authority without requiring a descriptor argument.
    * open(): On Unix, this is a source of ambient authority, but in NaCl it is only available outside the browser when in debug mode, which is OK.
 * No unavoidably-granted authority
    * In NaCl, this means it should be possible to choose what descriptors a NaCl process is started with.
    * Currently, the `<embed>` element always starts NaCl processes with a descriptor that provides access to the DOM, providing access to all of the web app's ambient authority (cookies, etc.).  There is no way to start a process other than `<embed>`, so no way to start a new process without this descriptor.
