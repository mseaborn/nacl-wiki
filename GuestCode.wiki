#summary Establishing a sandbox within Native Client's sandbox

= Guest code in Native Client =

== Introduction ==
Web apps may wish to run _guest code_ under Native Client -- that is, code which runs with less authority than the web app itself.  The guest code is less trusted than the main web app.

For example, guest code might not be allowed to use the cookies for the web app's origin.  Guest code might have limited access to the DOM.

== Requirements ==
 * No sources of ambient authority, i.e. syscalls that provide authority without requiring a descriptor argument
    * open(): only available in debug mode
 * Ability to choose what descriptors a NaCl process is started with

== See also ==
 * DeterministicExecution: a restriction that could be applied to some guest code
