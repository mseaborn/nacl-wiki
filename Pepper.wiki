#summary Pepper interface for browser plugins

== Introduction ==

Pepper is an interface that web browsers (specifically, Chromium) provide for implementing browser plugins.  Pepper started out as an extension to Mozilla's widely-used [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPAPI NPAPI] interface, but Pepper v2 provides a new API that is not an extension to NPAPI.

[ChromiumIntegration NaCl's integration with Chromium] is implemented using Pepper.  However, NaCl also makes a Pepper-based interface available to web apps over [IMCSockets IPC].
