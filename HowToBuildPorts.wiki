#summary How to build x86 NaCl, including toolchain

== Building on Linux (Ubuntu Lucid x86_64) ==
 * Check out the Native Client sources using gclient
 * Uninstall Automake and Autoconf (they are not required and are likely the wrong version)
 * On Ubuntu Lucid:
{{{
sudo apt-get install g++-multilib libsdl1.2-dev texinfo libcrypto++-dev libssl-dev lib32ncurses5-dev
}}}
 * On Ubuntu Lucid x86_64 some GCC packages (`libmpfr-dev`, 'libcloog-ppl-dev', 'libppl0.10-dev', 'libmpc-dev', 'libgmp3-dev') does not have the necessary 32-bit version of the library installed.  Two options:
  * uninstall these libraries completely (this would use the sources in the tree)
  * Use the installation script to install the library to your system:
{{{
sudo apt-get install libmpfr-dev libcloog-ppl-dev libppl0.10-dev libmpc-dev libgmp3-dev
cd native_client/tools
bash lucid64.x86_64.toolchain.prep.sh
}}}
  * The script prompts you how to get unpacked library files and header files and copy them to your system directories
