#summary Tasks for the nacl-glibc port

= nacl-glibc tasks =

Stages:
 * Build a statically-linked glibc and run a "hello world" program under sel_ldr.  This should work both in `-d` debug mode and with ncval_stubout (which replaces non-validating instructions with HLTs). See http://codereview.chromium.org/2072005/show
 * Build a dynamically-linked glibc and run ld.so under sel_ldr to print its help message
 * Run ld.so on a "hello world" executable; this uses libc.so
 * Run more complex programs, e.g. Python
 * Run programs in the context of the web browser
 * Fix all validation failures so that we don't need ncval_stubout
 * Be able to run glibc's test suite

Build integration:
 * Set this up on Buildbot
 * Extend tools/Makefile or tools/modular-build to do the glibc build
 * Extend the Scons build to be able to run the tests using glibc

Tidy ups:
 * Change glibc build system not to use wildcard rules (those generated into sysd-rules by Makerules)
    * This will make it easier to override files in sysdeps/i386 (for example) without having to remove sysdeps/i386 from the search path entirely.
    * This will also speed up the build, because GNU make's wildcard rules take quadratic time, and glibc uses a lot of them.
 * Remove copy of NaCl header files; pull these in from outside at build time
 * Remove dependency on Linux kernel headers

== Version control ==
nacl-glibc will be in Git in this repository: http://git.chromium.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=nacl-glibc.git

This is intended to replace the earlier nacl-glibc branch: http://repo.or.cz/w/glibc/nacl-glibc.git
