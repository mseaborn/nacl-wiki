#summary Support for the Breakpad crash dumper

== Introduction ==

Breakpad is a library for catching crashes and sending crash dumps to an upstream server for debugging purposes.  It is enabled in the official Chrome builds, but not by default in Chromium builds.

Crash handling is complicated by the fact that crashes can potentially occur in untrusted and trusted code.  A crash in NaCl's trusted code would indicate a bug in NaCl which we would like to track down.  A crash in untrusted code is expected, however, in the sense that it does not necessarily indicate a bug in NaCl.  We need to ensure that untrusted code can not crash in such a way that it can take control of the crash handler.
