#summary Project Ideas for Native Client.

=== Testing ===
  * Contribute tests. We always need more tests.
  * Write fuzzing tests for Native Client module interfaces.
  * Write fuzzing tests for the validator.

=== Application Development ===

Port a Linux open source game to Native Client. Here's a couple relevant lists:
  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_video_games
  * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_emulators
 
Start work on one of the obvious applications:
  * image editor
  * drawing program (remember MacDraw?)
  * spreadsheet
  * speech recognition or synthesis

=== Infrastructure ===
Port a popular open source Linux library to Native Client. See native_client_sdk for some libraries we've already ported.
  * Port SWIG to generate Native Client stubs on top of the Native Client IMC. This could help us allow languages like Python to make calls into the browser/JavaScript environment
  * Port GTK to Native Client
  * Port something a lot easier than SWIG or GTK

Port your favorite language system to Native Client. Awk, Lua, Python, Ruby, have been ported or are underway. 
  * Port gcj or other interpreted Java system to Native Client.
  * Port a new compiler/language to Native Client: ML, Lisp, Scheme, Smalltalk, Prolog, Cobal, Fortran.
  * Develop a NPAPI/Pepper interface for one of these languages.
