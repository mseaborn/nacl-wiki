#summary Project Ideas for Native Client.

=== Testing ===
  * Contribute tests. We always need more tests.
  * Write fuzzing tests for Native Client module interfaces.
  * Write fuzzing tests for the validator.

=== Application Development ===
Start work on one of the obvious applications:
  * image editor
  * drawing program (remember MacDraw?)
  * spreadsheet
  * speech recognition or synthesis

=== Infrastructure ===
Port your favorite open-source library or system to Native Client.
  * Port SWIG to generate Native Client stubs on top of the Native Client IMC. This could help us allow languages like Python to make calls into the browser/JavaScript environment
  * Port GTK to Native Client
  * Port something a lot easier than SWIG or GTK

Port your favorite language system to Native Client.
  * Help with the Python or Ruby ports to Native Client.
  * Port gcj or other interpreted Java system to Native Client.
  * Port a new compiler/language to Native Client: ML, Lisp, Scheme, Smalltalk, Prolog, Cobal, Fortran.

=== Security Projects ===
    * Client authentication. What can Native Client provide to help a server be confident that the client it is talking to is an authentic and unadulterated Native Client module?
