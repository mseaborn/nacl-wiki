#summary Making NaCl work with Chromium's Linux sandbox

== Introduction ==
Currently NaCl's Chromium integration does not work when combined with Chromium's [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxSandboxing Linux sandbox] (specifically, the [http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxSUIDSandbox SUID sandbox]).  Using NaCl under Chromium requires the options `--internal-nacl --no-sandbox` (e.g. see [http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2010/02/dev-channel-update_12.html this announcement]).

== Tasks ==
The following things need to be done to make this work:

 * Make the combination work without `--no-sandbox`.  This means making the renderer process work.
    * Currently the plugin gives an assertion failure when it fails to open `/dev/urandom`, killing the renderer process.  The fix is to open `/dev/urandom` before switching on sandboxing.
    * The SRPC plugin tries to open `/dev/shm/XXX` to use shared memory, which fails.
 * Make sel_ldr run under the sandbox:
    * Ensure that standalone sel_ldr can work under the sandbox.  Test this by running NaCl's test cases in this sandbox.  (Some tests will work but others require filesystem access and will not work.)
    * Ensure that the sel_ldr side of the NaCl plugin works under the sandbox.  Is there a way of testing this in isolation from the web browser?
    * Hook it up in Chromium so that sel_ldr is launched in the sandbox.
