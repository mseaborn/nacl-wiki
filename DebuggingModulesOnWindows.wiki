#summary Debugging tips for Windows

Using printf is impractical on Windows
because you can't effectively get standard I/O output
from the version of `sel_ldr`
that's installed by default.
The problem occurs because on Windows,
only the debug version of `sel_ldr`
sends output to the console.
(Only the debug version is compiled with 
`/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE`) 
To install the debug version of `sel_ldr`, first build it by running `.\scons.bat --mode=dbg-win` and then run `.\scons.bat DBG=1 firefox_install`. After the debug version is installed, a console window will appear for each instance of `sel_ldr` created by the browser plugin. An option that will allow redirecting the output from a Native Client module into a file is in development.
