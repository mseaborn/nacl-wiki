#summary Debugging tips for Windows

Using printf is impractical on Windows
because you can't effectively get standard I/O output
from the version of `sel_ldr`
that's installed by default.
The problem occurs because on Windows,
only the debug version of `sel_ldr`
sends output to the console.
(Only the debug version is compiled with 
`/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE`.)

_PENDING: This page should talk about DBG=1 and other issues related to the console.
It should also give some tips for debugging with Visual Studio._
