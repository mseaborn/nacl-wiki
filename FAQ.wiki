== General Native Client Questions ==

=== What is Native Client? ===

Native Client is an open-source research technology from Google for running x86 native code in web applications, with the goal of maintaining the browser neutrality, OS portability, and safety that people expect from web apps.

=== Why is the download so large? ===

As this release is mainly intended for the security and research communities, we focused on making them self-contained, and making it build robustly, at the cost of download size. For the "nacl_mac" download, here's what you get (uncompressed sizes):

    * SDK 3rd party source for gcc, binutils, and other tools (67MB)
    * Prebuilt SDK (60MB)
    * Native Client prebuilt binaries (plug-in, container, examples) (22MB)
    * Image source for the map used to generate the spinning globe (5MB)
    * Source, documentation, everything else (9MB)

One download gives you everything you need to try the system, build your own Native Client modules, and even build the SDK, plugins, and secure module container.

=== Why doesn't Native Client work on 64-bit Windows? ===

The short answer is that we intend to support 64-bit Windows, but it's going to take some time because our 32-bit Windows solution depends on APIs that aren't in some 64-bit versions. For the long answer, see the [http://groups.google.com/group/native-client-discuss/browse_thread/thread/3683b35e9ec74f02 discussion group post].

== Build/Install Questions ==

=== Why isn't the plug-in loading? ===

Assuming you've already
[http://nativeclient.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/nacl/googleclient/native_client/documentation/getting_started.html#plugin installed the plug-in],
verify that all files required by the plug-in are in place.
For example, on Windows three files are required:
`sel_ldr.exe`, `SDL.dll`, and `npGoogleNaClPlugin.dll`.
See FilesInstalled for details.

=== Why is make failing in cygwin (Windows)? ===

See the explanation and workaround in the discussion group: [http://groups.google.com/group/native-client-discuss/browse_thread/thread/a14268f6bd36cb83 notes for makefiles, cygwin, and windows].

=== I see a warning in my Windows build: "is Pywin32 present?" Should I worry? ===

No, not as long as your build finished successfully.
