== General Native Client Questions ==

=== What is Native Client? ===

Native Client is an open-source research technology from Google for running x86 native code in web applications, with the goal of maintaining the browser neutrality, OS portability, and safety that people expect from web apps.


== Build/Install Questions ==

=== Why isn't the plug-in loading? ===

Assuming you've already
[http://nativeclient.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/nacl/googleclient/native_client/documentation/getting_started.html#plugin installed the plug-in],
verify that all files required by the plug-in are in place.
For example, on Windows three files are required:
`sel_ldr.exe`, `SDL.dll`, and `npGoogleNaClPlugin.dll`.
See FilesInstalled for details.

=== Why is make failing in cygwin (Windows)? ===

See the explanation and workaround in the discussion group: [http://groups.google.com/group/native-client-discuss/browse_thread/thread/a14268f6bd36cb83 notes for makefiles, cygwin, and windows].

=== I see a warning in my Windows build: "is Pywin32 present?" Should I worry? ===

No, not as long as your build finished successfully.
