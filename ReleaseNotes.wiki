#summary Information about each release

Release notes are in the `RELEASE_NOTES` file in the `nacl/googleclient/native_client/` directory of the distribution.

*Note:* The date in the release notes might not match the date in this page. The date in the notes reflects when the notes were edited, which might be a few days before the release; this page lists the day the release went out.

You can find copies of the release notes in the SVN depository:
