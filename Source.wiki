#summary How to get the Native Client source code

*Quick links:* [http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/source/browse#svn/trunk/src/native_client browse source] | [http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/source/list recent changes]

== Browsing the source code ==

If you just want to look at the source code, you can either [http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/source/browse#svn/trunk/src/native_client browse] it online or download it with [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion]. Here's how to download the latest version of the source code:

  `svn checkout http://nativeclient.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src`

If you use `svn checkout`, the source code appears under a directory named `src` in the current directory. You can update it using `svn update`.

== Getting buildable source code ==

If you want to build the latest version of Native Client, follow these steps:

   # If you don't already have `gclient`, get it by downloading the Chromium [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-gclient depot tools].<br><br>
   # If you don't already have [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] (1.6 or later), download it.<br><br>
   # Create a directory to hold the Native Client source code. We'll call it `$NACL_ROOT`.<br><br>*Important:* Make sure the path to the directory has no spaces. Examples of good `$NACL_ROOT` values:<br><br>`/home/me/SVN/nativeclient`    <em>(Linux)</em><br>`/Users/me/SVN/nativeclient`   <em>(Mac)</em><br>`C:\SVN\nativeclient`          <em>(Windows)</em><br><br>
   # In a shell window, execute the following commands:
{{{
cd $NACL_ROOT
gclient config http://nativeclient.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/native_client
}}}
   # Download the code (this might take a few minutes):
{{{
cd $NACL_ROOT
gclient sync
}}}

Here's what the `gclient` steps do:
  * `gclient config` sets up your working directory, creating a `.gclient` file that identifies the structure to pull from the repository.
  * `gclient sync` creates several subdirectories and downloads the latest Native Client files.

To update the Native Client source code, run `gclient sync` from `$NACL_ROOT` or any of its subdirectories.

Once you've downloaded the source code, you can build Native Client. To do so, you need Python and a platform-specific development environment. Details on prerequisites and how to build are in [http://nativeclient.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/native_client/documentation/building.html Building Native Client].
