#summary NaCl Debugging

= Introduction =

==Goal==
The goal is to provide a mechanism for symbolic debugging of the untrusted aspects of Native Client applications in isolation.   The trusted service run-time should be invisible to the user much the way that OS system calls are invisible during casual application debugging.

==Summary==
Both for speed of development, and portability, we have decided to use the standard GDB serial debug protocol (a.k.a. RSP - Remote Serial Protocol).  This protocol runs between the target (the application being debugged) and the host (the debugger instance, usually GDB).   Using RSP allows us to maintain an avenue for GDB compatibility while focusing on the larger windows audience and enabling windows based debugging tools.  The stub and link libraries discussed here are a portion of the overall solution.
